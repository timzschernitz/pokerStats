# Poker Stat Tracker Indie Project #

### Problem Statement ###

Presently there are many online solutions for individuals to join in
online friendly games of poker. One such application is Poker Mavens
which I personally have experience in using with a group of up to 20
other individuals weekly. While the application itself is quite sufficient
and easy to use, it lacks any kind of historical statistical tracking.

The goal of my indie project is to create a supplementary application in
order to allow the host of periodically held poker games to easily enter
each player's outcome each game played. Additionally, as each game of
poker plays the same regardless of the application facilitating the game,
the poker stat tracker will not be limited to just games played through
Poker Mavens.

### User Stories ###
Can be found within this public kanban board:

The only tickets I would not consider being MVP would be implementing
Chart JS or some comparable visual add on to display stats.  Additionally,
deleting users might not be necessary up front either.

### Web Services ###
I haven't yet come up with a web service I could think of. Still thinking
on what I might be able to include. The Poker Mavens site we use to play
poker does have APIs I could interact with though the problem is that the
poker application is run locally on my friends network so I don't know if
I could get him to leave it open all the time to be able to use and test on.
So otherwise if not, I'm trying to think of alternate web services I could
implement instead.
