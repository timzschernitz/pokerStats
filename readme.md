# Poker Stat Tracker Indie Project #

### Problem Statement ###

Presently there are many online solutions for individuals to join in
online friendly games of poker. One such application is Poker Mavens
which I personally have experience in using with a group of up to 20
other individuals weekly. While the application itself is quite sufficient
and easy to use, it lacks any kind of historical statistical tracking.

The goal of my indie project is to create a supplementary application in
order to allow the host of periodically held poker games to easily enter
each player's outcome each game played. Additionally, as each game of
poker plays the same regardless of the application facilitating the game,
the poker stat tracker will not be limited to just games played through
Poker Mavens.
